# Deep Switching Auto-Regressive Factorization (DSARF)

This repository is a user-friendly pytorch implementation of our AAAI'21 paper: [Deep switching auto-regressive factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05135). DSARF performs switching dynamical systems modeling.

This [notebook](./DSARF_Examples.ipynb) includes several examples of using DSARF for short- and long-term forecasting and dynamical state estimation.

Also, check this [notebook](./Documentation.ipynb) for DSARF documentation and model overview.

To access older version of our code see [DSARF_v0.0](./DSARF_v0.0)
